City wants to start a bike rental service based on subscriptions where customers pays an annual fee that will allow them to go to a station,
select a bike, undock it, ride and then park it in another station.

It can support two types of bicycles : Mechanical and Electric . All stations have a maximum capacity.

The solution should be scalable.
